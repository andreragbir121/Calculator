#### Description: Basic calculator created using HTML/CSS and JavaScript, with the ability to calculator modula, subtraction, addition, division and multiplications
## Calculator Web Application
The calculator is a sleek and interactive web-based app which was designed to perform arithmetic operations, with a clean and modern user interface. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a smooth user experience with responsive design features, allowing it to be accessible on a variety of devices, including mobile, tablet, desktops etc. The calculator was themed with a bright and attractive gradient setting of blue, with the background and the buttons in white and blue gradient. In addition, the white and blue gradient, switches position when the user hovers, giving a more appealing appearance.

## Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations
The calculator supports all basic mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus. Users can input numbers and operators seamlessly, and the results will be displayed instantly in the blank textbox upon pressing the equals button, which is located exactly at the top of all the buttons.

## Advanced Functionality
In addition to the basic calculations, the calculator includes the modulo operator (%) for remainder-based computations and support for parentheses structured expression, which the calculator will follow the BODMAS rule (Brackets, Operations, Division, Multiplication, Addition and final step with Subtraction). It's also functional for the calculation of float numbers for example: 9.5 + 1.61. The delete button will allow users to correct mistakes by erasing the last entered digit or operator, ensuring accuracy in their calculations.

## User-Friendly Interface
The design prioritized usability with large, clearly labeled buttons, imported from https://fontawesome.com/, and adjusted for capable readability. The hover effects on buttons provide visual feedback, enabling a more visual appearance, and enhancing the interactive experience of the user. The layout is optimized for both touch and mouse input, making it convenient across different devices.

## Responsive Design
The calculator is dynamically adjusted based on its layout of the screen size, ensuring optimal functionality on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Media queries in the CSS file modify button sizes, spacing, and text dimensions to maintain usability on smaller screens without compromising functionality.

## Technologies Used
HTML5 – Provides the structural foundation for the calculator’s buttons and display.
CSS3 – Maintains the styling, animations, and responsive behavior with media queries.
JavaScript – Enables the functionality of calculation logic, button interactions, and real-time output updates.
Font Awesome – Enhances the visual appeal with icons for operators (+, -, ×, ÷) and functional buttons like delete.

## Usability
Since this is a client-side web application, No installation is required. Users can simply open the the index file or url to the file in any web browser to start using the calculator immediately.
Numbers – The button numbers range from 0-9 for user to select and mix combinations, whether 1 or more digits eg. 2 or 24 or 541.51, as long as the numbers are entered simultaneously and do not have any symbols or operators in between, the calculations will be accurate.  
Select Operators – there are 5 different operators for users to choose from to perform calculation, including, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus (+, -, ×, ÷, or %)
Calculating Results – To calculate the final results, users are required to press the equals (=) button to evaluate the expression.
Correct Mistakes – Mistakes can easily be removed by entering the last digit/operator in the calculator by selecting the delete button.
Use Parentheses – The parentheses allow the ability to calculate complex operations, open and close brackets to structure calculations properly.
